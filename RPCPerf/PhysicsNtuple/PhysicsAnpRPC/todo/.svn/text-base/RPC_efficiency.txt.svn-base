 - Correlate AND and OR for phi and eta for same layer, doublet gas gap
 - Correlate RPC efficiency with DCS state in COOL
   Follow with Marco and Alessandro about accessing COOL data
 - Plot time residuals per CM in eta and phi for RPC panels
   alignment constant per CM with ~3ns precision
 - Noise scan once per year with beam off
   setup random trigger with partial event building for RPC only
 - DCS HV scan for ATLAS as a function of time
   measure pinch voltage V0, exponential and linear slopes - Hong Kong
   important measurements that can be published
 - Optimisation of HV and thresholds of panels - open big task
   300  HV channels - low granularity
   3000 thresholds - roughly per panel (can double for phase 2)
   there are correlations between thresholds and panel efficiency
